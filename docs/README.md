# Overview

Use-wallet is a comprehensive wallet management solution for Algorand/AVM dApps. It reduces the complexity of wallet integrations, letting developers focus on core application logic.

The library is framework-agnostic and can be used in any modern front-end stack, with official adapters for [React](framework/react.md), [Vue](framework/vue.md), and [SolidJS](framework/solidjs.md).

Version 4.x introduces several major improvements:

* **Algorand SDK v3** - Full support for [Algorand JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk) v3
* **Runtime Node Configuration** - Let users connect to their private Algorand nodes ([guide](guides/runtime-node-configuration.md))
* **Custom Networks** - Add support for custom network configurations

See the [Migration Guide](guides/migrating-from-v3.x.md) for help upgrading from v3.x.
