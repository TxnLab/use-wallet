# üóÉÔ∏è WalletManager API

{% hint style="info" %}
The framework adapters abstract the `WalletManager` class and expose a similar API via the `useWallet` function/hook.
{% endhint %}

The following API is exposed via the `WalletManager` class instance:&#x20;

```typescript
class WalletManager {
  constructor({
    wallets: Array<T | WalletIdConfig<T>>,
    network?: NetworkId,
    algod?: NetworkConfig
  }: WalletManagerConstructor)
}
```

***

### setActiveNetwork

```
