# üë©‚Äçüîß Start Building

Once you've configured the `WalletManager`, you're ready to start integrating wallet functionality into your application. The next steps typically involve:

1. Creating a wallet connection menu
2. Implementing transaction signing functionality

Use-wallet is unopinionated about UI implementation, giving you the flexibility to design your wallet integration in a way that best suits your application's needs and style.

## Quick Start Guides

These guides provide practical examples of how to build a connect menu and sign transactions using `@txnlab/use-wallet` in your chosen framework.

## Example Applications

* [React Example App](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet/tree/main/examples/react-ts)
* [Vue Example App](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet/tree/main/examples/vue-ts)
* [Solid.js Example App](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet/tree/main/examples/solid-ts)
* [Next.js Example App](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet/tree/main/examples/nextjs)
* [Nuxt.js Example App](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet/tree/main/examples/nuxt)
* [Vanilla TypeScript Example App](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet/tree/main/examples/vanilla-ts) (using the core library without a framework adapter)

These example apps demonstrate basic implementations of `@txnlab/use-wallet` in various environments, showcasing how to effectively use the library in different frameworks as well as with the core library alone.

You can find these examples in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet) under the [`examples/`](https://github.com/TxnLab/use-wallet/tree/main/examples) directory:
